#### Project: Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects we've converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. We were given a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We've also added a service worker to create a 'better than nothing' offline experience for the users.

### Specification

We've been provided with the base code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had it's issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn't include any standard accessibility features, and it doesnâ€™t work offline at all. The goal was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintining the included functionality.

### How can you experience the project?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use. If you decide to use a different port than 8000, in dbhelper.js change `const port = YOUR_PORT`) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`(`http://localhost:YOUR_PORT`), and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like. I would appreciate any feedback on my work.
